# [verify_heater heater_bed]
# max_error: 250
# #   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
# #   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
# #   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
# #   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
# #   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
# #   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
# #   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
# #   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
# #   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
# #   120.
# #check_gain_time:
# #   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
# #   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
# #   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
# #   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
# #   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
# #   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
# #   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
# #hysteresis: 5
# #   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
# #   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
# #   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
# #   value. The default is 5.
# heating_gain: 0.5
# #   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
# #   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
# #   value. The default is 2.
